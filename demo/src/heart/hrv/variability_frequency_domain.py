VLF Power (0.003-0.04 Hz) - very low frequency power
LF Power (0.04-0.15 Hz) - low frequency power (sympathetic/parasympathetic)
HF Power (0.15-0.4 Hz) - high frequency power (parasympathetic)
LF/HF Ratio - sympathovagal balance indicator
Total Power - overall spectral power
Peak Frequency - frequency of maximum spectral density
Normalized LF (LFnu) - LF power in normalized units
Normalized HF (HFnu) - HF power in normalized units
