Circadian Rhythm Metrics
Circadian Phase - timing of internal biological clock
Phase Shift - deviation from expected circadian timing
Amplitude - strength of circadian rhythm
Acrophase - time of peak circadian activity
Mesor - circadian rhythm-adjusted mean
Interdaily Stability (IS) - consistency of circadian patterns
Intradaily Variability (IV) - fragmentation of circadian rhythm
